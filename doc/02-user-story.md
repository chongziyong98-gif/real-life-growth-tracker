# User Story

As a person who wants to improve myself but often loses consistency,
I want a system that turns my daily actions into XP and levels,
so that I can clearly see my growth and stay motivated over time.

As a user who enjoys RPGs,
I want my life to feel like a progression system,
so that my real-world efforts feel meaningful and trackable.

As someone who prefers visual feedback,
I want a character sheet-like interface,
so that I can view my strengths, weaknesses, and development path at a glance.
