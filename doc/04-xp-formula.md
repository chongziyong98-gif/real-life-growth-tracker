# XP Formula

XP is awarded based on the intensity, duration, and impact of an activity.

## Basic Formula
XP = Base Value × Duration Multiplier × Difficulty Modifier

### 1. Base Value
Simple actions start at 1–3 XP.
More meaningful actions start at 5–10 XP.

### 2. Duration Multiplier
- 10 minutes = ×1
- 30 minutes = ×2
- 1 hour = ×3

### 3. Difficulty Modifier
- Easy = ×1.0
- Medium = ×1.5
- Hard = ×2.0

## Example
Reading for 30 minutes (medium difficulty):

Base Value (Knowledge 2 XP) × Duration (2×) × Difficulty (1.5)
= 2 × 2 × 1.5
= 6 XP

### Level Curve (Initial Draft)
Level 1 → 2 : 10 XP  
Level 2 → 3 : 20 XP  
Level 3 → 4 : 35 XP  
Level 4 → 5 : 55 XP  

Curve will grow non-linearly to maintain long-term motivation.

### Lifestyle Balance KPI
KPIs include:
- Sleep quality 
- Nutrition habits 
- Productivity Load
- Housekeeping 
- Self-care routines 
- Mindfulness or meditation 
- Controlled leisure duration

Rules:
If KPIs drop below baseline → Penalty to other stats (realistic burnout model)
If KPIs are healthy → XP gain boost in other attributes
