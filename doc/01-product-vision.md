# Product Vision

To turn real-life personal development into an engaging RPG-style experience by transforming everyday habits, actions, and learning activities into measurable character growth. 

The goal is simple: make becoming a better version of yourself feel as rewarding and motivating as leveling up a protagonist in a game.
