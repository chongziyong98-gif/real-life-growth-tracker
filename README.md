# Real-Life-Growth-Tracker

Real-Life-Growth Tracker is a personal growth project inspired by the stat-building mechanics found in Persona 5 Royal (P5R).  
The goal is to transform real-life actions into an RPG-style progression system, enabling users to "level up" various life attributes such as Knowledge, Charisma, Discipline, Emotional Stability, and Fitness.

This repository serves as a portfolio project documenting the entire development process — from concept, design, and daily execution logs, to prototypes and (eventually) a full application.

## Project Objective
To build a gamified personal development system that makes real-life improvement as engaging as leveling up a character in an RPG.

## Key Features (Planned)
- A real-life stat system based on defined attributes  
- XP system tied to daily actions  
- Level progression and unlockable milestones  
- Weekly progress reports  
- Clean UI inspired by modern RPG character sheets  
- MVP prototype built with Notion/Excel or Streamlit  
- Full App development roadmap
